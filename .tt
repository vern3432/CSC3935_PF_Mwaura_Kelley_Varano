Okay so here is what we need to do. Once the library is sent to the client from server.java on a thread, we need that thread to wait for a file directory string from the clietn socket connection. The clietn will snd this only when an Image button is pressed, sending the file path contained in the Image button. When the client recieves this, it will init a new RTP server with an avalible port, it will then send that port back to the client, and then start its rtp server. The clietn  will initalize a new rtp client, start it and  try to connect to that port number. If it doesnt at first sleep for 5 seconds and try again> please imlement this fully and mkae it completel y fnuctional
